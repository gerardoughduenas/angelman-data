    "BriefSummary": "There is increasing evidence that chronic sleep disorders in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) are associated with disturbed melatonin secretion and melatonin administration has been shown to be effective in these populations. For children who have difficulties swallowing a tablet, Neurim has developed an age-appropriate Melatonin formulation in the form of mini-tablets which have the same dissolution profile as the Circadin\u00ae tablets product, thus should produce the same melatonin concentration-time profile with the same effects. This study concerns the pharmacokinetic study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to :\n\n* Establish the 24 hour baseline profile of endogenous saliva melatonin concentrations and urine 6-SMT excretion in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.\n* Establish the concentration-time profile of saliva melatonin concentrations and 24 hour 6-SMT urine excretion after 2 and 10 mg Circadin\u00ae mini-tablets single dose administration in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.\n* Evaluate the adverse event profile after a single dose of 2 or 10 mg Circadin\u00ae mini-tablets in children aged 2 up to and including 17 years with neurodevelopmental disorders with sleep disturbances.",

    "StartDate": "2025-03",
    "BriefSummary": "Silver Russell Syndrome (SRS) is a rare imprinting disorder (about 1/16000). Parental imprinting is an epigenetic regulation phenomenon leading to the monoallelic expression of some genes. Its establishment takes place in the gametes and its maintenance is important at the early embryonic stage. Increase in the prevalence of conception by assisted reproductive technology (ART) has already been found in patients with imprinted disorder such as Angelman, Beckwith-Wiedemann or Prader Willi Syndromes, and more recently with SRS; ART is associated with an increase in the frequency of SRS. Several hypotheses are formulated to explain this increase. The first one is the involvement of the infertility etiology in the imprinting disorder genesis. The second one is the involvement of ART technics in the genesis of abnormal gamete imprinting during their manipulation or during imprinting maintenance at early embryonic stages.\n\nOur main objective is to estimate ART conceptions prevalence in children followed for a SRS. The secondary objectives are to estimate infertility prevalence among parents of patients with SRS, to estimate factors frequency possibly responsible for the genesis of imprinting anomalies among parents of patients with SRS, to describe the infertility causes and to detail ART technics used (stimulation protocols, type of fertilization used, modality of embryonic culture and transfer, embryonic characteristics).\n\nA transversal pilote study will be firstly conducted in parents of patients followed in Silver Russell Syndrome Reference Center (Pediatric Endocrine department, in Trousseau Hospital, Paris).\n\nData collection will be done by phone, after collecting the non-opposition of the parents, in order to complete a questionnaire concerning their fertility and conception mode of their child. If ART was used to conceive, a questionnaire concerning the details of the ART technics used will be sent to the doctor and:or the ART biologist, who performed the ART. The data will be anonymized and collected on a REDCap database.",

The Early Check screening will lead to earlier identification of newborns with rare health conditions in addition to providing important data on the implementation of this model program. Early diagnosis may result in health and development benefits for the newborns. Infants who have newborn screening in North Carolina will be eligible to participate, equating to over 120,000 eligible infants a year. Over 95% of participants are expected to screen negative. Newborns who screen positive and their parents are invited to additional research activities and services. Parents can enroll eligible newborns on the Early Check electronic Research Portal. Screening tests are conducted on residual blood from existing newborn screening dried blood spots. Confirmatory testing is provided free-of-charge for infants who screen positive, and carrier testing is provided to mothers of infants with fragile X. Affected newborns have a physical and developmental evaluation. Their parents have genetic counseling and are invited to participate in surveys and interviews. Ongoing evaluation of the program includes additional parent interviews.",

    "BriefSummary": "Creatine supplementation in RTT: a randomized controlled trial\n\nRett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by apparently normal early development (stage 1 of RTT) followed by loss of purposeful hand use, distinctive hand stereotypes, slow brain growth, loss of language, respiratory irregularities, gastrointestinal disturbances, gait abnormalities, seizures, and mental retardation. These symptoms typically appear between 6 and 18 months of age (stage 2). Subsequently, there is gradual stabilisation of severe mental retardation and motor compromise (stage 3). The majority (70% to 80%) of patients show mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MeCP2) gene, located on chromosome Xq28. MeCP2 encodes a transcription repressor protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues.\n\nAs RTT primarily affects females, only very few males with mutations in MeCP2 have been identified. Mutations in MeCP2 have also been identified in children with X-linked mental retardation, autism and a clinical phenotype that resembles Angelman Syndrome.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a dietary supplement on the biochemical and clinical parameter of RTT. About 80 % of labile methyl groups generated through the re-methylation cycle are used for the synthesis of creatine within the human organism. Supplementation of creatine will therefore increase the availability of labile methyl groups for different methylation reactions including methylation of DNA.\n\nThe study will be double blind and cross-over. The patients will get creatine monophosphate (200 mg/kg/d in three dosages per day) or placebo. After 6 months and a wash-out period of 4 weeks the groups are changed for the next 6 months.\n\nAll participants with RTT and mutations in MeCP2 will undergo physical and neurological exam, quantitative EEG, behavioral assessment, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological evaluations. Participants will have a follow-up after 3, 6, 10, 13 and 16 months (3 months after finishing the study), which will include similar assessments.",

    "BriefSummary": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) , hereafter referred to as autism, is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by genetic and environmental factors. Its core symptoms are social impairment, repetitive stereotyped behaviors, and restricted interests.\n\nThe 15q11-13 region of the human chromosome is a locus prone to structural abnormalities leading to neurological disorders. Maternal duplications within this region lead to Dup15q syndrome , which accounts for approximately 1% of ASD cases .\n\nThis region harbors multiple alleles, and current research indicates that the pathophysiological alterations in this syndrome primarily involve UBE3A . Among all genes in the 15q11-13 region, only UBE3A exhibits cell-type-specific maternal monoallelic expression . Consequently, duplication of the UBE3A gene is considered the primary pathogenic factor in the pathology of Dup15q syndrome.\n\nStudies show that the metabolic conversion of retinol to retinoic acid is impaired in ASD patients with UBE3A overexpression and corresponding animal models . Notably, dietary supplementation with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been shown to significantly ameliorate autism-like behaviors caused by UBE3A overexpression in male mice .\n\nThis study aims to evaluate ATRA treatment in children with Dup15q syndrome-related autism , assessing changes in their ADOS-2 scores , to potentially provide a novel therapeutic approach for autism treatment.",

    "BriefSummary": "There is mounting evidence to suggest that a treatment for Angelman syndrome is not just possible, but probable. The lack of known molecular targets associated with AS has hampered the development of specific therapeutics. However, a recent surge of potential therapeutics for other disorders associated with cognitive disruption has begun to be used in human clinical trials. The molecular modes of action for many of these new therapeutic agents have correlates to counter the molecular defects observed in AS. One such agent is minocycline (MC), a drug traditionally used as an antibiotic. This compound administered to a mouse model of AS showed a significant decrease in motor deficit and an increase in long term potentiation. The investigators believe a similar result will be observed when minocycline is administered to the AS patient and may lead to the development of an effective AS therapeutic.",

It is a major neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe developmental delay with significant intellectual disability, lack of oral language, motor, balance, and sensory impairments.\n\nWhile basic research and clinical trials are progressing, the scientific community is still searching for key biomarkers to assess significant improvements in individuals participating in clinical trials.\n\nEye tracking has been widely used in the diagnosis of social perception abnormalities in children with autism spectrum disorder, as has already been the case for other rare neurodevelopmental diseases. However, few studies have highlighted the usefulness of eye tracking as a diagnostic tool for social behavioral disorders in individuals with Angelman syndrome. Given the prevalence of autistic-like symptoms in patients with AS, if eye-tracking can identify abnormalities in social perception in children with Angelman syndrome, these measurements could become a biomarker for therapeutic studies in these patients.",

Indeed, this has helped to identify functionally altered areas in patients with temporal epilepsy by simply using the resting EEG signal. Furthermore, it has been seen that the propagation of neuronal avalanches (VNs) correlates with the morphological organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, NAs represent a measure with direct utility for studying functional reorganization pre and post drug/surgical treatment. In addition, the aperiodic portion of the signal may represent a noninvasive measure of the excitation/inhibition relationship, which is known of being altered both in epilepsy and in some rare neurodevelopmental syndromes (example: Angelman and Dup15q)",

Recently, various imprinting diseases were reported in animals (Large Offspring syndrome (LOS)) and humans (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS)) born after ART. In all cases, an imprinting defect was involved (loss of methylation at ICR2 in BWS, at SNRPN in AS and at IGF2R DMR2 in LOS). These data suggest that ART procedures may impair the establishment or the maintenance (following fertilization) of methylation marks at maternally imprinted loci. In view of these data, the aim of this study is to determine if children born following ART exhibit an increased risk of imprinting defects. If the answer is yes, the second objective is to identify the problematic step in the ART procedure and thus to suppress or modify this step.",
